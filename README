== Multivariate Autoregressive Library

Multivariate Autoregressive Library (libmvar) is a library written in ANSI C
for estimating the parameters of multivariate AR models, simulation of
multivariate AR processes, and analyzing eigenmodes of fitted multivariate AR
models. Multivariate Autoregressive Library currently depends on GSL for its
linear algebra operations.

The algorithms implemented in libmvar are described in the publications listed
in the reference section of this readme. For the sake of better readability,
the variable names are chosen to match the ones used in the referred
publications.
