== Version 0.1.0

 * GSL is interfaced for all linear algebra operations
 * Only simulation of multivariate AR(p) models are supported
 * If an error occurs, the process is terminated by invoking abort(3)
 * The test application merely invokes mvar_sim() for generating a MVAR(2) process

== Version 0.1.1

 * A shared library and Debian package are built
 * Supports multivariate AR(p) model estimating, see mvar_fit()

== Version 0.1.2

 * Minor fixes in Makefile
 * Improved implementation of mvar_sim()
 * Supports analysis of eigenmodes of AR(p) models, see mvar_eigen()
